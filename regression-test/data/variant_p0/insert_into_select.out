The 64-bit sequences are more complicated than the 32-bit\\nones because:\\n  a) the 64-bit versions of the 32-bit rotate-and-mask instructions\\n     work by replicating the lower 32-bits of the value-to-be-rotated into the\\n     upper 32 bits -- and integrating this into the cost modeling for the various\\n     bit group operations is non-trivial\\n  b) unlike the 32-bit instructions in 32-bit mode, the rotate-and-mask instructions\\n     cannot, in one instruction, specify the\\n     mask starting index, the mask ending index, and the rotation factor. Also,\\n     forming arbitrary 64-bit constants is more complicated than in 32-bit mode\\n     because the number of instructions necessary is value dependent.\\n\\nPlus, support for 'late masking' was added: it is sometimes more efficient to\\ntreat the overall value as if it had no mandatory zero bits when planning the\\nbit-group insertions, and then mask them in at the very end. Unfortunately, as\\nthe structure of the bit groups is different in the two cases, the more\\nfeasible implementation technique was to generate both instruction sequences,\\nand then pick the shorter one.\\n\\nAnd finally, we now generate reasonable code for i64 bswap:\\n\\n        rldicl 5, 3, 16, 0\\n        rldicl 4, 3, 8, 0\\n        rldicl 6, 3, 24, 0\\n        rldimi 4, 5, 8, 48\\n        rldicl 5, 3, 32, 0\\n        rldimi 4, 6, 16, 40\\n        rldicl 6, 3, 48, 0\\n        rldimi 4, 5, 24, 32\\n        rldicl 5, 3, 56, 0\\n        rldimi 4, 6, 40, 16\\n        rldimi 4, 5, 48, 8\\n        rldimi 4, 3, 56, 0\\n\\nvs. what we used to produce:\\n\\n        li 4, 255\\n        rldicl 5, 3, 24, 40\\n        rldicl 6, 3, 40, 24\\n        rldicl 7, 3, 56, 8\\n        sldi 8, 3, 8\\n        sldi 10, 3, 24\\n        sldi 12, 3, 40\\n        rldicl 0, 3, 8, 56\\n        sldi 9, 4, 32\\n        sldi 11, 4, 40\\n        sldi 4, 4, 48\\n        andi. 5, 5, 65280\\n        andis. 6, 6, 255\\n        andis. 7, 7, 65280\\n        sldi 3, 3, 56\\n        and 8, 8, 9\\n        and 4, 12, 4\\n        and 9, 10, 11\\n        or 6, 7, 6\\n        or 5, 5, 0\\n        or 3, 3, 4\\n        or 7, 9, 8\\n        or 4, 6, 5\\n        or 3, 3, 7\\n        or 3, 3, 4\\n\\nwhich is 12 instructions, instead of 25, and seems optimal (at least in terms\\nof code size).\\n\\ngit-svn-id: https://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/llvm/trunk@225056 91177308-0d34-0410-b5e6-96231b3b80d8","distinct":true,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/llvm-mirror/llvm/commits/84cd524ee9ce4128770632acd3964c994427e8d8"}]}	true	2015-01-01T11:00:18

The 64-bit sequences are more complicated than the 32-bit\\nones because:\\n  a) the 64-bit versions of the 32-bit rotate-and-mask instructions\\n     work by replicating the lower 32-bits of the value-to-be-rotated into the\\n     upper 32 bits -- and integrating this into the cost modeling for the various\\n     bit group operations is non-trivial\\n  b) unlike the 32-bit instructions in 32-bit mode, the rotate-and-mask instructions\\n     cannot, in one instruction, specify the\\n     mask starting index, the mask ending index, and the rotation factor. Also,\\n     forming arbitrary 64-bit constants is more complicated than in 32-bit mode\\n     because the number of instructions necessary is value dependent.\\n\\nPlus, support for 'late masking' was added: it is sometimes more efficient to\\ntreat the overall value as if it had no mandatory zero bits when planning the\\nbit-group insertions, and then mask them in at the very end.
